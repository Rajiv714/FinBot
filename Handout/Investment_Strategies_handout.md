## 2. Fundamental Concepts & Theoretical Foundation (1200+ words)

**Core Definitions and Terminology with Detailed Explanations:**

*   **Investment Strategy:** A comprehensive plan outlining how an investor will allocate their capital to achieve specific financial objectives. These objectives can include capital appreciation (growth), income generation (dividends or interest), or capital preservation (protecting against losses). A well-defined investment strategy considers factors such as risk tolerance, time horizon, and financial goals.
*   **Option Strategy:** A specific investment strategy that utilizes options contracts. Options are derivative instruments, meaning their value is derived from an underlying asset. Option strategies can be used for a variety of purposes, including hedging (reducing risk), speculation (profiting from price movements), and income generation.
*   **Spread Strategy:** An option strategy that involves holding multiple options positions simultaneously. These positions are carefully selected to profit from a specific range of price movements in the underlying asset. Spread strategies are often used to limit risk and reduce the cost of implementing a particular directional view. Examples include Bull Call Spreads, Bear Put Spreads, and Iron Condors.
*   **Bull Call Spread:** A specific type of spread strategy employed when an investor anticipates a moderate increase in the price of an underlying asset. It involves buying a call option at a lower strike price and simultaneously selling a call option at a higher strike price, both with the same expiration date. The profit potential is limited to the difference between the strike prices, less the net premium paid.
